                 <p>In the second year of my CMD studies, I had to recreate a website for the Front-end Development course in which you 
                    improved accessibility for the screen readers and added 5 extra things to complete it.</p>
                <p>The intention of this project was really to solve the problems of people with disabilities, although this project
                     focused on screen readers. The HTML had to be completely semantic and you had to put the right things in the 
                     right order (headings, paragraphs and img).</p>
                <p>This was the first subject of the year and I thought it was a really interesting subject. 
                    I have learned a lot in this profession and have also invested a lot of time in it.</p>
                <p>And I just want to say that below is a mockup of my site, but pink and that I am very proud of it.
                    That's one of the 5 things I added extra. With a button you can change the blue layout to the pink layout!</p>
        
                    <p><em>*Put in on mobile version to get the real site, because it's not responsive:)</em></p>
