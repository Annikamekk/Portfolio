                 <p>An acquaintance of mine just became self-employed and asked if I could make a logo to brighten 
                    up his name. Of course I did that with love! At first I came up with things that I liked,
                    but he didn't think that was something for his company, namely kitesurfing and roofing, and 
                    gave reasons for what he thought could be done.</p>
                <p>This was also my first assignment outside of my studies and I immediately enjoyed doing something different. 
                    I didn't put much time into it, especially with sketches, I do want to put more time into that in the future.</p>
