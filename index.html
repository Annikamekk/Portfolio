            <h2>Marked</h2>
            <p>MARKED was my first individual project at school,
                 where we had to help inter-national students explore
                  Amsterdam. The persona wanted to explore the good
                  cheap markets and so I based MARKED on that.</p>

            <h2>Annika's</h2>
            <p>Annika's is a restaurant inspired by the artist
                 Hendrik Nicolaas Werkman. Hendrik was a book printer 
                 and later became an expressionist artist, printing all
                  kinds of shapes until it became 'art'.</p>

            <h2>Absolut Vodka</h2>
            <p>In my second year I had a project where I had to recreate and 
                improve a website. This project was mainly about accessibility
                for screen readers. You also had to add animations that help 
                with accessibility.</p>

            <h2>MekkActive</h2>
            <p>A personal project for a self-employed person. He asked for a 
                logo with M&A in it, so first I gave him a few ideas and finally
                he gave me directions on how he wanted it and this is what
                came out..</p>
